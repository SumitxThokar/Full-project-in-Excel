# Full Project in Excel
This project showcases a full data cleaning and visualization process using Excel. The data used in this project was downloaded from Alex the Analyst GitHub. The objective of this Excel project is to analyze the relationship between our customers and their salary, gender, distance and age group. By collecting and organizing data on these variables, we aim to identify any patterns or trends that can help us better understand our customer base and tailor our products or services to their needs.<br>

### Data Cleaning
The data cleaning process involved several methods, including:
- Remove Duplicates: Used to remove any duplicate rows in the data set.
- Find and Replace: Used to replace any incorrect or inconsistent data with correct data.
- Changing data types: Used to change the data types of specific columns as per requirement.
- Nested if: Used to create complex conditions and categorize data as per the requirement.
### Data Visualization
The cleaned data was then used to create a Pivot table to summarize the data and provide useful insights. A beautiful dashboard was then created using slicers to provide an interactive and user-friendly experience for exploring the data.
